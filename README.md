## West Nile Virus (WNV) incidence in Chicago - Project
The project is devided in different notebooks and save on the IBM Watson cloud for data storage.
The goal of the project was to idetify the most abundant mosquito locations in Chicago as well as the likelihood of being infected with the WNV if bitten. Finally, the project was constructed in accordance with the IBM Cloud Garage Method for Data Science.

## Web applications:

[XRPD App](https://v110.shinyapps.io/xrpd_app2/)

The application is written in R using R Shiny and intended for the quantification of crystalline and amorphous content of drugs in pharmaceutical formulations.
Please refer to the `README.md` [file](https://github.com/FlemmingM/APPs/edit/master/xrpd_app2/README.md) before using the application.

[LDA - Topic Analysis App](https://v110.shinyapps.io/ccec17413af343de8478d9f56142d74f/)

The app is taking data from open questions such as surveys and extracts the most important topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
Subsequently, the data is visualised.

Please use the app provided below to get test data and upload them into the LDA app

[Downloader App](https://v110.shinyapps.io/test/)
This app can be used to download example data with 7 answered open questions. The file can then be imported for the topic analysis.
