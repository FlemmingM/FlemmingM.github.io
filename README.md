## Web applications:

[XRPD App](https://v110.shinyapps.io/xrpd_app2/)

The application is written in R using R Shiny and intended for the quantification of crystalline and amorphous content of drugs in pharmaceutical formulations.
Please refer to the `README.md` [file](https://github.com/FlemmingM/APPs/edit/master/xrpd_app2/README.md) before using the application.

[Topic Analysis App](https://v110.shinyapps.io/ccec17413af343de8478d9f56142d74f/)

[Downloader App](https://v110.shinyapps.io/test/)
This app can be used to download example data with 7 answered open questions. The file can then be imported for the topic analysis.
